Today will be my first test of the uberman sleep schedule. I've read so much about it and the idea intruiges me. My sleep schedule will be as follows:

<pre class="prettyprint">
First nap   12:30am - 1:00am
Second nap   4:00am - 4:30am
Third nap    7:30am - 8:00am
Fourth nap  12:00pm - 12:30pm
Fifth nap    5:00pm - 5:30pm
Sixth nap    9:00pm - 9:30pm
</pre> 

I'll start with 30 minute naps during the initial adjustment period and switch to 20 minute naps later. I've got my phone setup to use as an alarm. Last night in order to test the efficacy of the device I had the alarm set to go off every 30 minutes and it appears to work well enough for my purposes so long as I am able to convince myself to wake up as required when it does go off. I know this will be a pain in the ass to adjust too. In order to assist with the adjustment period I've purchased several video games to fixate on in between naps. My diet will also require adjustment as my metabolism adapts to the extended periods of being awake.
