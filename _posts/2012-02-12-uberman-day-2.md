Yesterday was a little difficult to adjust to. Waking up tired is a real pain in the ass but the worst part is waiting for your next rest period. While adapting to this sleep cycle I have found it is required that you don't think about the next sleep period. Either find a diversion or go insane. I've found several effective diversions at the moment, namely video games, and updating this blog. I reactivated my Eve Online account as I felt it was safer than reactivating my WoW account. I never was really addicted to Eve that same way I was with WoW, and I find the game a welcome distraction while waiting for my alarm to ring off my next napping period. 

Oddly enough this morning I feel great. However, I must admit that I have cheated a bit. Rather than do 30 minute naps off the bat I decided that to adjust to the new sleep cycle it would be best to do 1 hour rests. I think I have adapted well the first day mainly because of this. The next challenge will be cutting those rest periods down to 45m and then 30m and then 20m durations. I'm certainly not out of the woods yet. Although I do feel more optimistic after today that I will be able to successfully adapt to this new sleep schedule.
