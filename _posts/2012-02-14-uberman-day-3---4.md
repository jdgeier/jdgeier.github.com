I didn't blog yesterday mainly because I fucked up on my sleep schedule. I went to take my 12:30am "nap" and didn't wake until 5:30am. I was disappointed to say the least but I feel that I learned an important lesson. I debated whether I should continue or not and decided that I should keep going. I really need to work on distracting myself. That seems odd I know but it seems to be real important during the adjustment phase. I still have trouble sleeping at 12:00pm and 5:00pm but I'm starting to adjust I think. Its also very important that when the 30 minute nap is over that immediately get up, if I do not I'll fall back asleep. The sleep deprivation seems to be getting the best of me at times. My thoughts are incongruous but that is to be expected. Hopefully when the adjustment period is over I won't feel so bad.
