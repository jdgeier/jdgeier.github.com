Someone calling himself the "Heartland Insider" has leaked several documents revealing the Heartland Institute's attempt to provide a curriculum that suggests that climate change is a controversial and uncertain science. The documents in question can be located on the [DeSmogBlog](http://www.desmogblog.com/heartland-insider-exposes-institute-s-budget-and-strategy) 

The Heartland Institute considers itself to be a "think tank". In reality the organization receives funds from Philip Morris, Reynolds American to stifel policies related to tobacco products and also takes money from the Koch Brother to produce "studies" that paint climate change as little more than a quack science. More importantly though the Heartland Institute is really nothing more than a lobby group that is trying to prevent positive policies from being implemented by the government. 

This is why I despise the fact that science literacy has somehow started to divide on political party lines. Republicans have effectively become the anti-science party and the people who often vote for republican tend to endorse this behavior. Science is not a "liberal agenda" just because you don't like the facts doesn't make them go away. Nor does it change the fact that the problems still exist.
